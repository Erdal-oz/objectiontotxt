# objectiontotxt
A really really simple program to convert objection files from https://objection.lol/ to readable txt files.

I am not experienced with creating projects or programming stuff for public use so if there are any problems i would appreciate feedback.


## Usage

This program is used as a commandline program.

For giving filenames of the .objection files
```
$ objtoxt --filename file1 file2 file3...
```

For giving the directory where the .objection files are at
```
$ objtotxt -d directory1 directory2...
```
