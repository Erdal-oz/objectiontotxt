# objectiontotxt
A really really simple program to convert objection files from https://objection.lol/ to readable txt files.

I am not experienced with creating projects or programming stuff for public use so if there are any problems i would appreciate feedback.


**Currently only works for courtroom recordings/ objection entries with nicknames**
